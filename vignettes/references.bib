	Abstract        = {Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is a mainstay of therapy for children with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its overall association with patient outcome is unclear. To test the hypothesis that ICP monitoring is associated with improved functional survival of children with severe TBI. A propensity-weighted effectiveness analysis was conducted using 2 linked national databases with data from 30 US children's hospitals from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2012, on 3084 children with severe TBI. Clinical events including neurosurgical procedures were identified using validated computable phenotypes. Data analysis was conducted from September 1, 2016, to March 1, 2017. Placement of an ICP monitor. A composite of hospital mortality, discharge to hospice, or survival with placement of new tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes. Of the 3084 children in the study (1128 girls and 1956 boys; mean [SD] age, 7.03 [5.44] years), 1002 (32.4%) underwent ICP monitoring, with substantial hospital variation (6% to 50% by hospital). Overall, 484 children (15.7%) experienced the primary composite outcome. A propensity approach using matching weights generated good covariate balance between those who did and those who did not undergo ICP monitoring. Using a propensity-weighted logistic regression model clustered by hospital, no statistically significant difference was found in functional survival between monitored and unmonitored patients (odds ratio of poor outcome among those who underwent ICP monitoring, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.99-1.74). In a prespecified secondary analysis, no difference in mortality was found (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.89-1.50). Prespecified subgroup analyses of children younger and older than 2 years of age and among those with unintentional and inflicted (intentional) injuries also showed no difference in outcome with ICP monitoring. With the use of linked national data and validated computable phenotypes, no evidence was found of a benefit from ICP monitoring on functional survival of children with severe TBI. Intracranial pressure monitoring is a widely but inconsistently used technology with incompletely demonstrated effectiveness. A large prospective cohort study or randomized trial is needed.},

  Abstract      = {To develop and validate case definitions (computable phenotypes) to accurately identify neurosurgical and critical care events in children with traumatic brain injury. Prospective observational cohort study, May 2013 to September 2015. Two large U.S. children's hospitals with level 1 Pediatric Trauma Centers. One hundred seventy-four children less than 18 years old admitted to an ICU after traumatic brain injury. Prospective data were linked to database codes for each patient. The outcomes were prospectively identified acute traumatic brain injury, intracranial pressure monitor placement, craniotomy or craniectomy, vascular catheter placement, invasive mechanical ventilation, and new gastrostomy tube or tracheostomy placement. Candidate predictors were database codes present in administrative, billing, or trauma registry data. For each clinical event, we developed and validated penalized regression and Boolean classifiers (models to identify clinical events that take database codes as predictors). We externally validated the best model for each clinical event. The primary model performance measure was accuracy, the percent of test patients correctly classified. The cohort included 174 children who required ICU admission after traumatic brain injury. Simple Boolean classifiers were greater than or equal to 94% accurate for seven of nine clinical diagnoses and events. For central venous catheter placement, no classifier achieved 90% accuracy. Classifier accuracy was dependent on available data fields. Five of nine classifiers were acceptably accurate using only administrative data but three required trauma registry fields and two required billing data. In children with traumatic brain injury, computable phenotypes based on simple Boolean classifiers were highly accurate for most neurosurgical and critical care diagnoses and events. The computable phenotypes we developed and validated can be used in any observational study of children with traumatic brain injury and can reasonably be applied in studies of these interventions in other patient populations.},

	Abstract      = {In children with traumatic brain injury, 1) to describe the hospital discharge functional outcome and change from baseline function using the Functional Status Scale and 2) to determine any associations between discharge Functional Status Scale and age, injury mechanism, neurologic examination, imaging, and other predictors of outcome. Prospective observational cohort study, May 2013 to November 2015. Two U.S. children's hospitals designated as American College of Surgeons level 1 pediatric trauma centers. Children less than 18 years old admitted to an ICU with acute traumatic brain injury and either a surgical or critical care intervention within the first 24 hours or in-hospital mortality. None. The primary outcome was hospital discharge Functional Status Scale. Most, 133 of 196 (68%), had severe traumatic brain injury (admission Glasgow Coma Scale, 3-8). Overall hospital mortality was 14%; 20% among those with severe traumatic brain injury. Hospital discharge Functional Status Scale had an inverse relationship with Glasgow Coma Scale: for each increase in admission Glasgow Coma Scale by 1, the discharge Functional Status Scale decreased by 0.5 (95% CI, 0.7-0.3). Baseline Functional Status Scale was collected at one site (n = 75). At that site, nearly all (61/62) of the survivors had normal or near-normal (≤ 7) preinjury Functional Status Scale. More than one-third, 23 of 62 (37%), of survivors had new morbidity at hospital discharge (increase in Functional Status Scale, ≥ 3). Among children with severe traumatic brain injury who had baseline Functional Status Scale collected, 21 of 41 survivors (51%) had new morbidity at hospital discharge. The mean change in Functional Status Scale from baseline to hospital discharge was 3.9 $\pm$ 4.9 overall and 5.2 $\pm$ 5.4 in children with severe traumatic brain injury. More than one-third of survivors, and approximately half of survivors with severe traumatic brain injury, will have new morbidity. Hospital discharge Functional Status Scale, change from baseline Functional Status Scale, and new morbidity acquisition can be used as outcome measures for hospital-based care process improvement initiatives and interventional studies of children with traumatic brain injury.},

  Abstract    = {Nonaccidental trauma has become a leading cause of death in infants and toddlers. Compared with children suffering from accidental trauma, many children with nonaccidental trauma present with injuries requiring neurosurgical management and operative interventions.A retrospective review was performed concerning the clinical and radiological findings, need for neurosurgical intervention, and outcomes in infants and toddlers with head injuries who presented to Albany Medical Center between 1999 and 2007. The Fisher exact probability test and ORs were computed for Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, hyperdense versus hypodense subdural collections, and discharge and follow-up King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI) scores.There were 218 patients, among whom 164 had sustained accidental trauma, and 54 had sustained nonaccidental trauma (NAT). The patients with accidental traumatic injuries were more likely to present with GCS scores of 13-15 (OR 6.95), and the patients with NATs with of GCS scores 9-12 (OR 6.83) and 3-8 (OR 2.99). Skull fractures were present in 57.2\% of accidentally injured patients at presentation, and 15\% had subdural collections. Skull fractures were present in 30\% of nonaccidentally injured patients, and subdural collections in 52\%. Patients with evidence of hypodense subdural collections were significantly more likely to be in the NAT group (OR 20.56). Patients with NAT injuries were also much more likely to require neurosurgical operative intervention. Patients with accidental trauma were more likely to have a KOSCHI score of 5 at discharge and follow-up (ORs 6.48 and 4.58), while patients with NAT had KOSCHI scores of 3a, 3b, 4a, and 4b at discharge (ORs 6.48, 5.47, 2.44, and 3.62, respectively), and 3b and 4a at follow-up.Infant and toddler victims of NAT have significantly worse injuries and outcomes than those whose trauma was accidental. In the authors' experience, however, with aggressive intervention, many of these patients can make significant neurological improvements at subsequent follow-up visits.},

  Abstract       = {BACKGROUND: On the basis of mixed results from previous trials, we assessed whether therapeutic hypothermia for 48-72 h with slow rewarming improved mortality in children after brain injury. METHODS: In this phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomised controlled trial, we included patients with severe traumatic brain injury who were younger than 18 years and could be enrolled within 6 h of injury. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence to randomly allocate patients (1:1; stratified by site and age [<6 years, 6-15 years, 16-17 years]) to either hypothermia (rapidly cooled to 32-33 degrees C for 48-72 h, then rewarmed by 0.5-1.0 degrees C every 12-24 h) or normothermia (maintained at 36.5-37.5 degrees C). The primary outcome was mortality at 3 months, assessed by intention-to-treat analysis; secondary outcomes were global function at 3 months after injury using the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) and the GOS-extended pediatrics, and the occurrence of serious adverse events. Investigators assessing outcomes were masked to treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00222742. FINDINGS: The study was terminated early for futility after an interim data analysis on data for 77 patients (enrolled between Nov 1, 2007, and Feb 28, 2011): 39 in the hypothermia group and 38 in the normothermia group. We detected no between-group difference in mortality 3 months after injury (6 [15%] of 39 patients in the hypothermia group vs two [5%] of 38 patients in the normothermia group; p = 0.15). Poor outcomes did not differ between groups (in the hypothermia group, 16 [42%] patients had a poor outcome by GOS and 18 [47%] had a poor outcome by GOS-extended paediatrics; in the normothermia group, 16 [42%] patients had a poor outcome by GOS and 19 [51%] of 37 patients had a poor outcome by GOS-extended paediatrics). We recorded no between-group differences in the occurrence of adverse events or serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Hypothermia for 48 h with slow rewarming does not reduce mortality of improve global functional outcome after paediatric severe traumatic brain injury.

  Abstract       = {INTRODUCTION: The Barell body region by nature of injury diagnosis matrix standardizes data selection and reports, using a two dimensional array (matrix) that includes all International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9-CM codes describing trauma. AIM: To provide a standard format for reports from trauma registries, hospital discharge data systems, emergency department data systems, or other sources of non-fatal injury data. This tool could also be used to characterize the patterns of injury using a manageable number of clinically meaningful diagnostic categories and to serve as a standard for casemix comparison across time and place. CONCEPT: The matrix displays 12 nature of injury columns and 36 body region rows placing each ICD-9-CM code in the range from 800 to 995 in a unique cell location in the matrix. Each cell includes the codes associated with a given injury. The matrix rows and columns can easily be collapsed to get broader groupings or expanded if more specific sites are required. The current matrix offers three standard levels of detail through predefined collapsing of body regions from 36 rows to nine rows to five rows. MATRIX DEVELOPMENT: This paper presents stages in the development and the major concepts and properties of the matrix, using data from the Israeli national trauma registry, and from the US National Hospital Discharge Survey. The matrix introduces new ideas such as the separation of traumatic brain injury (TBI), into three types. Injuries to the eye have been separated from other facial injuries. Other head injuries such as open wounds and burns were categorized separately. Injuries to the spinal cord and spinal column were also separated as are the abdomen and pelvis. Extremities have been divided into upper and lower with a further subdivision into more specific regions. Hip fractures were separated from other lower extremity fractures. FORTHCOMING DEVELOPMENTS: The matrix will be used for the development of standard methods for the analysis of multiple injuries and the creation of patient injury profiles. To meet the growing use of ICD-10 and to be applicable to a wider range of countries, the matrix will be translated to ICD-10 and eventually to ICD-10-CM. CONCLUSION: The Barell injury diagnosis matrix has the potential to serve as a basic tool in epidemiological and clinical analyses of injury data.},

  Abstract    = {To document the characteristics of early posttraumatic seizures (EPTS) in non-accidental head injury (NAHI), and examine their relation with outcome, a retrospective study was carried out. All children with NAHI admitted to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, since 1981 were identified. The characteristics of EPTS, EEG, and outcome were noted. Forty-four cases were identified. The average age of children at presentation was 5.9 months. Thirty-two of these children had EPTS. The median length of follow-up was 3 years. The mortality rate was six in 44 (14\%). The neurodevelopmental outcome correlated significantly with the presence and severity of EPTS (Tau = 0.317,p = 0.017). Of survivors, 22\% developed late posttraumatic epilepsy; the outcome in those with epilepsy was significantly worse than those without (p<0.0001). It was concluded that the severity of the primary brain injury dictates the severity of the EPTS and neurodevelopmental status at follow-up.},

  Abstract       = {The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and its most recent revision, the GOS-Extended (GOS-E), provide the gold standard for measuring traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcome. The GOS-E exhibits validity when used with adults and some adolescents, but validity with younger children is not established. Because the GOS-E lacks the developmental specificity necessary to evaluate children, toddlers, and infants, we modified the original version to create the GOS-E Pediatric Revision (GOS-E Peds), a developmentally appropriate structured interview, to classify younger patients. The criterion, predictive, and discriminant validity of the GOS-E Peds was measured in 159 subjects following TBI (mild: 36%; moderate: 12%; severe: 50%) at 3 and 6 months after injury. Participants were included from two studies completed at the Pediatric Neurotrauma Center at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. We assessed the relationship among GOS-E Peds, the GOS, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales as well as other standardized measures of functional, behavioral, intellectual, and neuropsychological outcome. Premorbid function was assessed 24-36 h after injury. The GOS-E Peds showed a strong correlation with the GOS at 3 and 6 month time points. Criterion-related validity was also indicated by GOS-E Peds' association with most measures at both time points and at injury severity levels. The 3 month GOS-E Peds was associated with the 6 month GOS-E Peds, everyday function, behavior, and most cognitive abilities. Discriminant validity is suggested by weak correlations between both 3 and 6 month GOS-E Peds and premorbid measures. The GOS-E Peds is sensitive to severity of injury and is associated with changes in TBI sequelae over time. This pediatric revision provides a valid outcome measure in infants, toddlers, children, and adolescents through age 16. Findings support using the GOS-E Peds as the primary outcome variable in pediatric clinical trials.},

  Abstract    = {Record linkage may create powerful datasets with which investigators can conduct comparative effectiveness studies evaluating the impact of tests or interventions on health. All linkages of health care data files to date have used protected health information (PHI) in their linkage variables. A technique to link datasets without using PHI would be advantageous both to preserve privacy and to increase the number of potential linkages.We applied probabilistic linkage to records of injured children in the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB, N = 156,357) and the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS, N = 104,049) databases from 2007 to 2010. 49 match variables without PHI were used, many of them administrative variables and indicators for procedures recorded as International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification codes. We validated the accuracy of the linkage using identified data from a single center that submits to both databases.We accurately linked the PHIS and NTDB records for 69\% of children with any injury, and 88\% of those with severe traumatic brain injury eligible for a study of intervention effectiveness (positive predictive value of 98\%, specificity of 99.99\%). Accurate linkage was associated with longer lengths of stay, more severe injuries, and multiple injuries.In populations with substantial illness or injury severity, accurate record linkage may be possible in the absence of PHI. This methodology may enable linkages and, in turn, comparative effectiveness studies that would be unlikely or impossible otherwise.},

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database (January 2001 to June 2011). PARTICIPANTS: Children (aged <18 years) with TBI and head Abbreviated Injury Scale scores of at least 3 who were ventilated for at least 96 consecutive hours or who died in the first 4 days after hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Monitoring of ICP. RESULTS: A total of 4667 children met the study criteria. Hospital mortality was 41% (n = 1919). Overall, 55% of patients (n = 2586) received ICP monitoring. Expected hospital ICP monitoring rates after adjustment for patient age, cardiac arrest, inflicted injury, craniotomy or craniectomy, head Abbreviated Injury Scale score, and Injury Severity Score were 47% to 60%. Observed hospital ICP monitoring rates were 14% to 83%. Hospitals with more observed ICP monitoring, relative to expected, and hospitals with higher patient volumes had lower rates of mortality or severe disability. After adjustment for between-hospital variation and patient severity of injury, ICP monitoring was independently associated with age 1 year and older (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.5-3.8) vs age younger than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: There was significant between-hospital variation in ICP monitoring that cannot be attributed solely to differences in case mix. Hospitals that monitor ICP more frequently and hospitals with higher patient volumes had better patient outcomes. Infants with TBI are less likely to receive ICP monitoring than are older children.},

The available data sources vary widely in the level of clinical detail and the types of questions they can reliably answer. Linkage of data sources can expand the types of questions that a data source can be used to study. Careful matching of the scientific question to the best available data source or linked data sources is necessary.

  Abstract       = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the risk factors for acquiring functional or cognitive disabilities during admission to a PICU. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a multicenter PICU database. SETTING: Twenty-four PICUs in the Virtual PICU Performance System network from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2010. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients, who are 1 month to 18 years old, who survived to discharge. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcomes were acquired global functional disability and cognitive disability during admission to a PICU, measured by change in Pediatric Overall Performance Category or in Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scores, respectively. The primary analysis cohort consisted of 29,352 admissions to the 24 Virtual PICU Performance System sites which collected the main outcome variables. Respectively, 10.3% and 3.4% of the cohort acquired global functional or cognitive disability. Trauma diagnosis (odds ratio, 4.50; 95% CI, 3.83-5.29; odds ratio, 3.91; 95% CI, 3.07-4.98), unscheduled admission to the PICU (odds ratio, 2.67; 95% CI, 2.27-3.12; odds ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16-2.00), highest risk of mortality category (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.15-3.40), oncologic primary diagnoses (odds ratio, 5.61; 95% CI, 4.56-6.91; odds ratio, 4.30; 95% CI, 2.97-6.24), and neurologic primary diagnoses (odds ratio, 2.04, 95% CI, 1.70-2.44; odds ratio, 4.29, 95% CI, 3.18-5.78) were independently associated with acquiring both functional and cognitive disability. Intervention risk factors for acquiring both functional and cognitive disability included invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.60-2.00; odds ratio, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.36-3.39), renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.73-3.42; odds ratio, 1.76, 95% CI, 1.08-2.85), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.24-2.95; odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.02-3.23), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (odds ratio, 7.40, 95% CI, 4.10-13.36; odds ratio, 14.04, 95% CI, 7.51-26.26). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a subset of patients whose potential for acquiring global functional and cognitive disability during admission to the PICU is high. This population may benefit from interventions that could mitigate this risk and from focused follow-up after discharge from the PICU.},

  Abstract    = {Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant clinical problem with few therapeutic interventions successfully translated to the clinic. Increased importance on the progressive, long-term consequences of TBI have been emphasized, both in the experimental and clinical literature. Thus, there is a need for a better understanding of the chronic consequences of TBI, with the ultimate goal of developing novel therapeutic interventions to treat the devastating consequences of brain injury. In models of mild, moderate, and severe TBI, histopathological and behavioral studies have emphasized the progressive nature of the initial traumatic insult and the involvement of multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, including sustained injury cascades leading to prolonged motor and cognitive deficits. Recently, the increased incidence in age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases in this patient population has also been emphasized. Pathomechanisms felt to be active in the acute and long-term consequences of TBI include excitotoxicity, apoptosis, inflammatory events, seizures, demyelination, white matter pathology, as well as decreased neurogenesis. The current article will review many of these pathophysiological mechanisms that may be important targets for limiting the chronic consequences of TBI.},

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: : Pediatric intensive care units in the United States that submit administrative data to the Pediatric Health Information System. PATIENTS: Children 1-18 yrs old treated in a Pediatric Health Information System pediatric intensive care unit for asthma during 2004-2008. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen-thousand five-hundred fifty-two children were studied; 2,812 (21%) were treated in a Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network and 10,740 (79%) were treated in a non-Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network pediatric intensive care unit. Medication use in individual Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network centers differed widely: ipratropium bromide (41%-84%), terbutaline (11%-74%), magnesium sulfate (23%-64%), and methylxanthines (0%-46%). Complications including pneumothorax (0%-0.6%), cardiac arrest (0.2%-2%), and aspiration (0.2%-2%) were rare. Overall use of medical therapies and complications at Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network centers were representative of pediatric asthma care at non-Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network pediatric intensive care units. Median length of pediatric intensive care unit stay at Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network centers was 1 to 2 days and death was rare (0.1%-3%). Ten percent of children treated at Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network centers received invasive mechanical ventilation compared to 12% at non-Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network centers. Overall 44% of patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation were intubated in the pediatric intensive care unit. Children intubated outside the pediatric intensive care unit had significantly shorter median ventilation days (1 vs. 3), pediatric intensive care unit days (2 vs. 4), and hospital days (4 vs. 7) compared to those intubated in the pediatric intensive care unit. Among children who received mechanical respiratory support, significantly more (41% vs. 25%) were treated with noninvasive ventilation and significantly fewer (41% vs. 58%) were intubated before pediatric intensive care unit care when treated in a Pediatric Health Information System hospital emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: Marked variations in medication therapies and mechanical support exist. Death and other complications were rare. More than half of patients treated with mechanical ventilation were intubated before pediatric intensive care unit care. Site of respiratory mechanical support initiation was associated with length of stay.},

  Abstract    = {The epidemiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often studied through the use of International classification of disease, ninth revision, clinical modification (ICD-9-CM), diagnosis codes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention TBI Surveillance System. Recent studies suggest that these codes may underestimate the burden of TBI because of inaccuracies and low sensitivity.To determine the sensitivity and specificity of ICD-9-CM codes in a severe TBI population.We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all hospital admissions including computed tomography of the head at a single center to identify severe blunt TBI patients, their injuries, and the neurosurgical procedures performed. We calculated sensitivity and specificity by comparing ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes assigned by hospital coders with medical records, the gold standard.In 2008, there were 148 qualifying admissions. These codes were 89\% sensitive for the presence of any severe TBI. However, one-fifth of these cases were identified only with a code defining a nonspecific head injury. Next, we studied types of TBI by categories defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (morbidity groups) and by ICD-9-CM codes for types of injury (any skull fracture, intracranial contusion, intracranial hemorrhage, concussion/loss of consciousness) and found widely varying sensitivity and specificity for both. In general, these codes had higher specificity than sensitivity. Both sensitivity and specificity were > 80\% for only 2 categories: any skull fracture and intracranial hemorrhage. In contrast, we found high sensitivity and specificity for neurosurgical procedures (97\% and 94\%).ICD-9-CM codes were sensitive for the presence of any severe TBI, but further classification of specific types of TBI was limited by variable sensitivity/specificity. Use of these codes should be supplemented by other methodology.},

  Abstract    = {To determine the feasibility of conducting a longitudinal prospective study to evaluate functional recovery and predictors of impaired functional recovery in critically ill children.Prospective pilot study.Single-center PICU at McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Canada.Children aged 12 months to 17 years, with at least one organ dysfunction, limited mobility or bed rest during the first 48 hours of PICU admission, and a minimum 48-hour PICU length of stay, were eligible. Patients transferred from a neonatal ICU prior to ever being discharged home, already mobilizing well or at baseline functional status at time of screening, with an English language barrier, and prior enrollment into this study, were excluded.None.The primary outcome was feasibility, as defined by the ability to screen, enroll eligible patients, and execute the study procedures and measurements on participants. Secondary outcomes included functional status at baseline, 3 and 6 months, PICU morbidity, and mortality. Functional status was measured using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory and the Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth. Thirty-three patients were enrolled between October 2012 and April 2013. Consent rate was 85\%, and follow-up rates were 93\% at 3 months and 71\% at 6 months. We were able to execute the study procedures and measurements, demonstrating feasibility of conducting a future longitudinal study. Functional status deteriorated following critical illness. Recovery appears to be influenced by baseline health or functional status and severity of illness.Longitudinal research is needed to understand how children recover after a critical illness. Our results suggest factors that may influence the recovery trajectory and were used to inform the methodology, outcomes of interest, and appropriate sample size of a larger multicenter study evaluating functional recovery in this population.},

  abstract    = {The goal of our study was to determine the interobserver variability between observers with different backgrounds and experience when interpreting computed tomography (CT) imaging features of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We retrospectively identified a consecutive series of 50 adult patients admitted at our institution with a suspicion of TBI, and displaying a Glasgow Coma Scale score < or =12. Noncontrast CT (NCT) studies were anonymized and sent to five reviewers with different backgrounds and levels of experience, who independently reviewed each NCT scan. Each reviewer assessed multiple CT imaging features of TBI and assigned every NCT scan a Marshall and a Rotterdam grading score. The interobserver agreement and coefficient of variation were calculated for individual CT imaging features of TBI as well as for the two scores. Our results indicated that the imaging review by both neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons were consistent with each other. The kappa coefficient of agreement for all CT characteristics showed no significant difference in interpretation between the neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists. The average Bland and Altman coefficients of variation for the Marshall and Rotterdam classification systems were 12.7\% and 21.9\%, respectively, which indicates acceptable agreement among all five reviewers. In conclusion, there is good interobserver reproducibility between neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons in the interpretation of CT imaging features of TBI and calculation of Marshall and Rotterdam scores.},

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of children 1 month to 12 years of age hospitalized for UTI at 25 children's hospitals from 1999 to 2004. We measured variability in length-of-stay (LOS), cost, readmission rate, intensive care unit admission, and performance of renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram and identified patient and hospital factors associated with these outcomes. RESULTS: The cohort included 20,892 children. There was significant variation in outcomes and processes of care across hospitals (eg, mean LOS, 2.1-5.0 days; patients with both imaging tests performed, 0.3%-72.9%). Older children had shorter LOS and were less likely to undergo imaging. Patients hospitalized at high volume hospitals were more likely to undergo imaging. Hospitals with high percentage of Medicaid patients had longer LOS and were less likely to perform imaging tests. Hospitals with a clinical practice guideline for UTI had shorter LOS and decreased costs per admission. CONCLUSIONS: The variability across hospitals may represent opportunities for benchmarking, standardization, and quality improvement. Decreased LOS and costs associated with clinical practice guidelines support their implementation.},

  Abstract       = {OBJECTIVE: With important technological advances in healthcare delivery and the Internet, clinicians and scientists now have access to overwhelming number of available databases capturing patients with critical illness. Yet, investigators seeking to answer important clinical or research questions with existing data have few resources that adequately describe the available sources and the strengths and limitations of each. This article reviews an approach to selecting a database to address health services and outcomes research questions in critical care, examines several databases that are commonly used for this purpose, and briefly describes some strengths and limitations of each. DATA SOURCES: Narrative review of the medical literature. SUMMARY: The available databases that collect information on critically ill patients are numerous and vary in the types of questions they can optimally answer. Selection of a data source must consider not only accessibility but also the quality of the data contained within the database, and the extent to which it captures the necessary variables for the research question. Questions seeking causal associations (e.g., effect of treatment on mortality) usually either require secondary data that contain detailed information about demographics, laboratories, and physiology to best address nonrandom selection or sophisticated study design. Purely descriptive questions (e.g., incidence of respiratory failure) can often be addressed using secondary data with less detail such as administrative claims. Although each database has its own inherent limitations, all secondary analyses will be subject to the same challenges of appropriate study design and good observational research. CONCLUSION: The literature demonstrates that secondary analyses can have significant impact on critical care practice. While selection of the optimal database for a particular question is a necessary part of high-quality analyses, it is not sufficient to guarantee an unbiased study. Thoughtful and well-constructed study design and analysis approaches remain equally important pillars of robust science. Only through responsible use of existing data will investigators ensure that their study has the greatest impact on critical care practice and outcomes.},

  Abstract    = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the commonest cause of acquired disability in childhood. A major obstacle to the evaluation of acute and rehabilitative therapies after TBI is the lack of simple descriptors of outcome. We developed the King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI), as a specific paediatric adaptation of the original adult Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). The KOSCHI expands the five category GOS to provide increased sensitivity at the milder end of the disability range. The GOS category of "persistent vegetative state" was replaced by "vegetative". "Good recovery" was allocated two categories, in acknowledgement of the long term importance of relatively minor sequelae in a developing child. The scale was quick and easy to use. Inter-rater reliability studies show that even with such an apparently simple scale, some training may be required. The KOSCHI provides a practical scale for paediatric head injury which will enable clinicians to describe rate and extent of recovery, and evaluate the effects of service and research interventions.},

  abstract    = {The use of health administrative data in health services research is facilitated by standardized classification systems, such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Canada, among other countries, recently introduced the tenth version of ICD and its accompanying Canadian Classification of Interventions (CCI). It is imperative to assess errors that could occur in administrative data due to the introduction of the new coding system.To evaluate the validity of procedure coding in hospital discharge data, comparing CCI with ICD-9-CM.Trained reviewers examined 4008 randomly selected charts from 4 teaching hospitals in Alberta, Canada, for the presence of 30 procedures. The charts, already coded using CCI, were recoded using ICD-9-CM. Comprehensive lists of procedure codes in both systems were identified using literature, health records technicians, surgeons and online resources.Three databases were created for the same hospital discharge record, including CCI, ICD-9-CM, and chart review data. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and kappa scores were calculated.Compared with the chart review data, ICD-9-CM data under-reported 17 procedures, over-reported 12, and equivalently reported 1. CCI data under-reported 19 procedures, over-reported 9, and equivalently reported 2. Kappa value was within 0.1 difference between ICD-9-CM and CCI for 14 procedures.Both ICD-9-CM and CCI coded the more major or invasive procedures reasonably well, but were not valid for less invasive or minor procedures. CCI can be used by health services and population health researchers with as much confidence as ICD-9-CM.},

Patients were assigned baseline POPC and PCPC scores derived from historical information and discharge scores at the time of discharge from the hospital (or from the pediatric intensive care unit for patients with multiple hospitalizations). Delta scores were calculated as the difference between the discharge scores and the baseline scores. The changes in POPC and PCPC scores were associated with several measures of morbidity (length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit, total hospital charges, and discharge care needs) and with severity of illness (pediatric risk of mortality score) or severity of injury (pediatric trauma score) (p less than 0.0001). Interrater reliability was excellent (r = 0.88 to 0.96; p less than 0.001). The POPC and PCPC scales are apparently reliable and valid tools for assessing the outcome of pediatric intensive care.},

The purpose of this study is to significantly extend the research on two such promising measures: the Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC) and the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC). DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a sample of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) discharges and a prospective follow-up of this cohort of children. SETTING: Arkansas Children's Hospital. PATIENTS: Two hundred children (ranging in age from birth to 21 yrs) discharged from a PICU. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were collected at PICU discharge, hospital discharge, and 1- and 6-month follow-up assessments after hospital discharge. Measures utilized included the POPC (at PICU discharge), PCPC (at PICU discharge), Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, fourth edition (at hospital discharge), Bayley Scales of Infant Development, second edition (at hospital discharge), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (at 1 and 6 months after discharge). Stanford-Binet Intelligence Quotients and Bayley Mental Developmental Index scores were significantly different across PCPC categories (p < .0001). Bayley Psychomotor Developmental Index scores and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales scores varied significantly across POPC categories (p < .0001). The test for linear trend was also significant for each of the comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study offer additional support for the use of the PCPC and POPC. These brief and easily completed measures can provide useful information regarding probable outcomes for pediatric intensive care patients when more extensive psychometric testing is not feasible or desirable.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to establish relationships between illness severity, length of stay, and functional outcomes in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) by using multi-institutional data. We hypothesized that a positive relationship exists between functional outcome scores, severity of illness, and length of stay. DESIGN: The study used a prospective multicentered inception cohort design. SETTING: The study was conducted in 16 PICUs across the United States that were member institutions of the Pediatric Critical Care Study Group of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. PATIENTS: In total, 11,106 patients were assessed, representing all admissions to these intensive care units for 12 consecutive months. MEASUREMENTS: Functional outcomes were measured by the Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC) and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) scales. Both scales were assessed at baseline and discharge from the PICU. Delta scores were formed by subtracting baseline scores from discharge scores. Other measurements included admission Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores, age, operative status, length of stay in the PICU, and diagnoses. Interrater reliability was assessed by using a set of ten standardized cases on two occasions 6 months apart. MAIN RESULTS: Baseline, discharge, and delta POPC and PCPC outcome scores were associated with length of stay in the PICU and with predicted risk of mortality (p < .01). Incorporation of baseline functional status in multivariate length of stay analyses improved measured fit. Mild baseline cerebral deficits in children were associated with 18% longer PICU stays after controlling for other patient and institutional characteristics. Moderate and severe baseline deficits for both the POPC and PCPC score predict increased length of stay of between 30% and 40%. On the standardized cases, interrater consensus was achieved on 82% of scores with agreement to within one neighboring class for 99.7% of scores. CONCLUSIONS: These data establish current relationships for the POPC and PCPC outcome scales based on multi-institutional data. The reported relationships can be used as reference values for evaluating clinical programs or for clinical outcomes research.},

The degree of variation in the use of antibiotics in children's hospitals is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 556,692 consecutive pediatric inpatient discharges from 40 freestanding children's hospitals between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2008. We used the Pediatric Health Information System to acquire data on antibiotic use and clinical diagnoses. RESULTS: Overall, 60% of the children received at least 1 antibiotic agent during their hospitalization, including >90% of patients who had surgery, underwent central venous catheter placement, had prolonged ventilation, or remained in the hospital for >14 days. Even after adjustment for both hospital- and patient-level demographic and clinical characteristics, antibiotic use varied substantially across hospitals, including both the proportion of children exposed to antibiotics (38%-72%) and the number of days children received antibiotics (368-601 antibiotic-days per 1000 patient-days). In general, hospitals that used more antibiotics also used a higher proportion of broad-spectrum antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Children's hospitals vary substantially in their use of antibiotics to a degree unexplained by patient- or hospital-level factors typically associated with the need for antibiotic therapy, which reveals an opportunity to improve the use of these drugs.},

  Abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Diagnosis information from existing data sources is used commonly for epidemiologic, administrative, and research purposes. The quality of such data for emergency department (ED) visits is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine the agreement on final diagnoses between two sources, electronic administrative sources and manually abstracted medical records, for pediatric ED visits, in a multicenter network. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study at 19 EDs nationwide. The authors obtained data from two sources at each ED during a three-month period in 2003: administrative sources for all visits and abstracted records for randomly selected visits during ten days over the study period. Records were matched using unique identifiers and probabilistic linkage. The authors recorded up to three diagnoses from each abstracted medical record and up to ten for the administrative data source. Diagnoses were grouped into 104 groups using a modification of the Clinical Classification System. RESULTS: A total of 8,860 abstracted records had at least one valid diagnosis code (with a total of 12,895 diagnoses) and were successfully matched to records in the administrative source. Overall, 67% (95% confidence interval = 66% to 68%) of diagnoses from the administrative and abstracted sources were within the same diagnosis group. Agreement varied by site, ranging from 54% to 77%. Agreement varied substantially by diagnosis group; there was no difference by method of linkage. Clustering clinically similar diagnosis groups improved agreement between administrative and abstracted data sources. CONCLUSIONS: ED diagnoses retrieved from electronic administrative sources and manual chart review frequently disagree, even if similar diagnosis codes are grouped. Agreement varies by institution and by diagnosis. Further work is needed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis coding; development of a grouping system specific to pediatric emergency care may be beneficial.},

  Abstract       = {INTRODUCTION: This report describes the case mix and outcome (mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay) for admissions to ICU for head injury and evaluates the predictive ability of five risk adjustment models. METHODS: A secondary analysis was conducted of data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) Case Mix Programme, a high quality clinical database, of 374,594 admissions to 171 adult critical care units across England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 1995 to 2005. The discrimination and calibration of five risk prediction models, SAPS II, MPM II, APACHE II and III and the ICNARC model plus raw Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) were compared. RESULTS: There were 11,021 admissions following traumatic brain injury identified (3% of all database admissions). Mortality in ICU was 23.5% and in-hospital was 33.5%. Median ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 3.2 and 24 days, respectively, for survivors and 1.6 and 3 days, respectively, for non-survivors. The ICNARC model, SAPS II and MPM II discriminated best between survivors and non-survivors and were better calibrated than raw GCS, APACHE II and III in 5,393 patients eligible for all models. CONCLUSION: Traumatic brain injury requiring intensive care has a high mortality rate. Non-survivors have a short length of ICU and hospital stay. APACHE II and III have poorer calibration and discrimination than SAPS II, MPM II and the ICNARC model in traumatic brain injury; however, no model had perfect calibration.},

  abstract    = {Emerging Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have reformed the modern healthcare. These records have great potential to be used for building clinical prediction models. However, a problem in using them is their high dimensionality. Since a lot of information may not be relevant for prediction, the underlying complexity of the prediction models may not be high. A popular way to deal with this problem is to employ feature selection. Lasso and l1-norm based feature selection methods have shown promising results. But, in presence of correlated features, these methods select features that change considerably with small changes in data. This prevents clinicians to obtain a stable feature set, which is crucial for clinical decision making. Grouping correlated variables together can improve the stability of feature selection, however, such grouping is usually not known and needs to be estimated for optimal performance. Addressing this problem, we propose a new model that can simultaneously learn the grouping of correlated features and perform stable feature selection. We formulate the model as a constrained optimization problem and provide an efficient solution with guaranteed convergence. Our experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed model is significantly more stable than Lasso and many existing state-of-the-art shrinkage and classification methods. We further show that in terms of prediction performance, the proposed method consistently outperforms Lasso and other baselines. Our model can be used for selecting stable risk factors for a variety of healthcare problems, so it can assist clinicians toward accurate decision making.},

  abstract    = {Modern healthcare is getting reshaped by growing Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Recently, these records have been shown of great value towards building clinical prediction models. In EMR data, patients' diseases and hospital interventions are captured through a set of diagnoses and procedures codes. These codes are usually represented in a tree form (e.g. ICD-10 tree) and the codes within a tree branch may be highly correlated. These codes can be used as features to build a prediction model and an appropriate feature selection can inform a clinician about important risk factors for a disease. Traditional feature selection methods (e.g. Information Gain, T-test, etc.) consider each variable independently and usually end up having a long feature list. Recently, Lasso and related l1-penalty based feature selection methods have become popular due to their joint feature selection property. However, Lasso is known to have problems of selecting one feature of many correlated features randomly. This hinders the clinicians to arrive at a stable feature set, which is crucial for clinical decision making process. In this paper, we solve this problem by using a recently proposed Tree-Lasso model. Since, the stability behavior of Tree-Lasso is not well understood, we study the stability behavior of Tree-Lasso and compare it with other feature selection methods. Using a synthetic and two real-world datasets (Cancer and Acute Myocardial Infarction), we show that Tree-Lasso based feature selection is significantly more stable than Lasso and comparable to other methods e.g. Information Gain, ReliefF and T-test. We further show that, using different types of classifiers such as logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machines, decision trees and Random Forest, the classification performance of Tree-Lasso is comparable to Lasso and better than other methods. Our result has implications in identifying stable risk factors for many healthcare problems and therefore can potentially assist clinical decision making for accurate medical prognosis.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this work was to determine cognitive and adaptive behavioral outcomes of children with traumatic brain injury acquired before age 2 years and to compare outcomes between inflicted versus noninflicted brain injury.All North Carolina children hospitalized in an ICU for a traumatic brain injury before age 2 years between the years 2000 and 2001 were eligible for study entry. A total of 112 surviving children were prospectively identified, 52 (46\%) of whom had complete follow-up. Thirty-one control children were recruited from preschool settings. Control subjects were chosen to be demographically similar to case subjects. Child measures of cognition and adaptive behavior at age 3 years were measured and compared between children with and without traumatic brain injury and children with inflicted and noninflicted traumatic brain injury.Sixty percent of injured children were > 1 SD below normal on cognitive testing. Forty percent of injured children scored > 1 SD below normal on adaptive behavior testing. Children with inflicted traumatic brain injury performed more poorly on tests of cognition and adaptive behavior. Glasgow Coma Scale > or = 13, absence of seizures, income above twice the poverty guidelines, and high social capital were associated with improved outcomes. Injured children had lower scores than uninjured control children after adjustment for socioeconomic status.Very young children with mild-to-severe traumatic brain injury as measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale are at risk for global cognitive deficits more than a year after the time of injury.

  Abstract                 = {Diagnosing inflicted traumatic brain injury (TBI) in young children is difficult in practice. Comparisons of children with inflicted and noninflicted TBI may help to identify markers of inflicted TBI. The objective of this study was to compare inflicted and noninflicted TBI in terms of presenting complaints, clinical features, and hospital outcomes.The presenting complaint, clinical finding, hospital course, and outcome of all children who were aged 2 years or younger in North Carolina and were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit or died with a TBI in 2000 and 2001 were reviewed. Clinical presentation and injury types were compared between children with inflicted and noninflicted TBI. Risk ratios were used to compare clinical and outcome characteristics between the 2 groups. Among survivors, multivariate binomial regression was used to examine the adjusted risk of a poor outcome dependent on injury type.A total of 80 (52.6\%) children had inflicted and 72 (47.3\%) children had noninflicted TBI. Children with noninflicted TBI (not in a motor vehicle crash) were more likely to present to the emergency department asymptomatic (44.8\% vs 8.3\%) and to have a specific history of trauma than children with inflicted TBI. Retinal hemorrhage, metaphyseal fracture, rib fracture, and subdural hemorrhage were more commonly found in children with inflicted compared with noninflicted TBI. Skeletal survey and ophthalmologic examination combined would have missed 8 (10.0\%) inflicted TBI cases.Manner of presentation and injury types are helpful in distinguishing inflicted TBI. Clinicians should not rule out inflicted TBI on the basis of skeletal survey and ophthalmoscopy alone but should proceed to computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging.},

      KnowledgeBase (PheKB,https://phekb.org), an online environment supporting the workflow of building, sharing, and validating electronic phenotype algorithms. We analyze the most frequent components used in algorithms and their performance at authoring institutions and secondary implementation sites.As of June 2015, PheKB contained 30 finalized phenotype algorithms and 62 algorithms in development spanning a range of traits and diseases. Phenotypes have had over 3500 unique views in a 6-month period and have been reused by other institutions. International Classification of Disease codes were the most frequently used component, followed by medications and natural language processing. Among algorithms with published performance data, the median PPV was nearly identical when evaluated at the authoring institutions (n = 44; case 96.0\%, control 100\%) compared to implementation sites (n = 40; case 97.5\%, control 100\%).These results demonstrate that a broad range of algorithms to mine electronic health record data from different health systems can be developed with high PPV, and algorithms developed at one site are generally transportable to others.By providing a central repository, PheKB enables improved development, transportability, and validity of algorithms for research-grade phenotypes using health care generated data.},

  Abstract    = {Mechanical ventilation is frequently performed in patients with ischemic stroke (IS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In this study, we used statewide administrative claims data to examine the rates of use, associated conditions, and in-hospital mortality rates for mechanically ventilated stroke patients.We used statewide administrative claims data from three states and ICD-9-CM codes to identify patients admitted with stroke and those who received mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Descriptive statistics and exact 95 \% confidence intervals were used to report rates of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and in-hospital mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify conditions associated with mechanical ventilation based on previously described risk factors.798,255 hospital admissions for stroke were identified. 12.5 \% of these patients underwent mechanical ventilation. This rate varied by stroke type: 7.9 \% for IS, 29.9 \% for ICH, and 38.5 \% for SAH. Increased age was associated with a decreased risk of receiving mechanical ventilation (RR per decade, 0.91). Of stroke patients who underwent mechanical ventilation, 16.3 \% received a tracheostomy. Mechanical ventilation was more likely to occur in association with status epilepticus (RR, 5.1), pneumonia (RR, 4.9), sepsis (RR, 3.6), and hydrocephalus (RR, 3.3). In-hospital mortality rate for mechanically ventilated stroke patients was 52.7 \% (46.8 \% for IS, 61.0 \% for ICH, and 54.6 \% for SAH).In this large population-based sample, over half of mechanically ventilated stroke patients died in the hospital despite the fact that younger patients were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation. Future studies are indicated to elucidate mechanical ventilation strategies to optimize long-term outcomes after severe stroke.},

  Abstract    = {We performed a retrospective, observational study at a level I pediatric trauma center of children with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) from January 2002 to September 2006 to identify clinical and radiographic risk factors for early post-traumatic seizures (EPTS). Two hundred and ninety-nine children ages 0-15 years were evaluated, with 24 excluded because they died before the initial head computed tomography (CT) was obtained (n = 20), or because their medical records were missing (n = 4). Records were reviewed for accident characteristics, pre-hospital hypoxia or hypotension, initial non-contrast head CT characteristics, seizure occurrence, antiepileptic drug (AED) administration, and outcome. All care was at the discretion of the treating physicians, including the use of AEDs and continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents. The primary outcome was seizure activity during the first 7 days as determined by clinician observation or EEG analysis. Of the 275 patients included in the study, 34 had identified EPTS (12\%). Risk factors identified on bivariable analysis included pre-hospital hypoxia, young age, non-accidental trauma (NAT), severe TBI, impact seizure, and subdural hemorrhage, while receiving an AED was protective. Independent risk factors identified by multivariable analysis were age <2 years (OR 3.0 [95\% CI 1.0,8.6]), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ≤8 (OR 8.7 [95\% CI 1.1,67.6]), and NAT as a mechanism of injury (OR 3.4 [95\% CI 1.0,11.3]). AED treatment was protective against EPTS (OR 0.2 [95\% CI 0.07,0.5]). Twenty-three (68\%) patients developed EPTS within the first 12 h post-injury. This early peak in EPTS activity and demonstrated protective effect of AED administration in this cohort suggests that to evaluate the maximal potential benefit among patients at increased risk for EPTS, future research should be randomized and prospective, and should intervene during pre-trauma center care with initiation of continuous EEG monitoring as soon as possible.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The Marshall computed tomographic (CT) classification identifies six groups of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), based on morphological abnormalities on the CT scan. This classification is increasingly used as a predictor of outcome. We aimed to examine the predictive value of the Marshall CT classification in comparison with alternative CT models. METHODS: The predictive value was investigated in the Tirilazad trials (n = 2269). Alternative models were developed with logistic regression analysis and recursive partitioning. Six month mortality was used as outcome measure. Internal validity was assessed with bootstrapping techniques and expressed as the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). RESULTS: The Marshall CT classification indicated reasonable discrimination (AUC = 0.67), which could be improved by rearranging the underlying individual CT characteristics (AUC = 0.71). Performance could be further increased by adding intraventricular and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and by a more detailed differentiation of mass lesions and basal cisterns (AUC = 0.77). Models developed with logistic regression analysis and recursive partitioning showed similar performance. For clinical application we propose a simple CT score, which permits a more clear differentiation of prognostic risk, particularly in patients with mass lesions. CONCLUSION: It is preferable to use combinations of individual CT predictors rather than the Marshall CT classification for prognostic purposes in TBI. Such models should include at least the following parameters: status of basal cisterns, shift, traumatic subarachnoid or intraventricular hemorrhage, and presence of different types of mass lesions.},

  Abstract       = {Abstract During the National Neurotrauma Symposium 2010, the DG Research of the European Commission and the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NIH/NINDS) organized a workshop on comparative effectiveness research (CER) in traumatic brain injury (TBI). This workshop reviewed existing approaches to improve outcomes of TBI patients. It had two main outcomes: First, it initiated a process of re-orientation of clinical research in TBI. Second, it provided ideas for a potential collaboration between the European Commission and the NIH/NINDS to stimulate research in TBI. Advances in provision of care for TBI patients have resulted from observational studies, guideline development, and meta-analyses of individual patient data. In contrast, randomized controlled trials have not led to any identifiable major advances. Rigorous protocols and tightly selected populations constrain generalizability. The workshop addressed additional research approaches, summarized the greatest unmet needs, and highlighted priorities for future research. The collection of high-quality clinical databases, associated with systems biology and CER, offers substantial opportunities. Systems biology aims to identify multiple factors contributing to a disease and addresses complex interactions. Effectiveness research aims to measure benefits and risks of systems of care and interventions in ordinary settings and broader populations. These approaches have great potential for TBI research. Although not new, they still need to be introduced to and accepted by TBI researchers as instruments for clinical research. As with therapeutic targets in individual patient management, so it is with research tools: one size does not fit all.},

  Abstract    = {Research in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is challenging for several reasons; in particular, the heterogeneity between patients regarding causes, pathophysiology, treatment, and outcome. Advances in basic science have failed to translate into successful clinical treatments, and the evidence underpinning guideline recommendations is weak. Because clinical research has been hampered by non-standardised data collection, restricted multidisciplinary collaboration, and the lack of sensitivity of classification and efficacy analyses, multidisciplinary collaborations are now being fostered. Approaches to deal with heterogeneity have been developed by the IMPACT study group. These approaches can increase statistical power in clinical trials by up to 50\% and are also relevant to other heterogeneous neurological diseases, such as stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Rather than trying to limit heterogeneity, we might also be able to exploit it by analysing differences in treatment and outcome between countries and centres in comparative effectiveness research. This approach has great potential to advance care in patients with TBI.},

  Abstract    = {Sparsity is often a desirable property of statistical models, and various feature selection methods exist so as to yield sparser and interpretable models. However, their application to biomedical text classification, particularly to mortality risk stratification among intensive care unit (ICU) patients, has not been thoroughly studied.To develop and characterize sparse classifiers based on the free text of nursing notes in order to predict ICU mortality risk and to discover text features most strongly associated with mortality.We selected nursing notes from the first 24h of ICU admission for 25,826 adult ICU patients from the MIMIC-II database. We then developed a pair of stochastic gradient descent-based classifiers with elastic-net regularization. We also studied the performance-sparsity tradeoffs of both classifiers as their regularization parameters were varied.The best-performing classifier achieved a 10-fold cross-validated AUC of 0.897 under the log loss function and full L2 regularization, while full L1 regularization used just 0.00025\% of candidate input features and resulted in an AUC of 0.889. Using the log loss (range of AUCs 0.889-0.897) yielded better performance compared to the hinge loss (0.850-0.876), but the latter yielded even sparser models.Most features selected by both classifiers appear clinically relevant and correspond to predictors already present in existing ICU mortality models. The sparser classifiers were also able to discover a number of informative - albeit nonclinical - features.The elastic-net-regularized classifiers perform reasonably well and are capable of reducing the number of features required by over a thousandfold, with only a modest impact on performance.},

  Abstract       = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of children admitted to intensive care in 1982, 1995, and 2005-2006, and their long-term outcome. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit in a university-affiliated children's hospital. DESIGN/METHODS: Information for 2005-2006 admissions was obtained from pediatric intensive care unit database, and long-term outcome was ascertained through telephone interviews. Results were compared to previous cohorts from 1982 and 1995. RESULTS: A total of 4010 children were admitted on 5250 occasions. Readmissions increased from 11% for 1982 to 31% in 2005 to 2006 (p < .001). In 2005-2006, fewer children were admitted after accidents (p < .001), or with croup (p < .001), or epiglottitis (p = .01), and 8% were treated with noninvasive ventilation compared to none in 1982 (p < .0001). Among children aged > or = 1 month, pediatric intensive care unit length of stay remained constant. The risk of death predicted by the Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) remained constant (approximately 6%) between 1995 and 2005-2006.The proportion that died in the pediatric intensive care unit fell from 11.0% in 1982 to 4.8% in 2005-2006 (p < .001). Among children aged > /= 1 month, proportion admitted with a preexisting moderate or severe disability was similar: 12.0% in 1982 and 14.6% in 2005-2006 (p = .11), but the proportion with a moderate or severe disability at follow-up increased from 8.4% in 1982 to 17.9% in 2005-2006 (p < .001). The proportion of children aged > or = 1 month who either died in the pediatric intensive care unit or survived with disability did not improve: it was 19.4% in 1982 and 22.7% in 2005-2006. CONCLUSION: Over the last three decades, the length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit and the severity of illness have not changed, but there has been a substantial reduction in pediatric intensive care unit mortality. However, the proportion of survivors with moderate or severe disability increased significantly. Some children who would have been allowed to die in 1982 and 1995 were kept alive in 2005-2006, but survived with disability. This trend has important implications for our patients and their families, and for the community as a whole.},

  Abstract    = {To examine potential sources of errors at each step of the described inpatient International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding process.The use of disease codes from the ICD has expanded from classifying morbidity and mortality information for statistical purposes to diverse sets of applications in research, health care policy, and health care finance. By describing a brief history of ICD coding, detailing the process for assigning codes, identifying where errors can be introduced into the process, and reviewing methods for examining code accuracy, we help code users more systematically evaluate code accuracy for their particular applications.We summarize the inpatient ICD diagnostic coding process from patient admission to diagnostic code assignment. We examine potential sources of errors at each step and offer code users a tool for systematically evaluating code accuracy.Main error sources along the "patient trajectory" include amount and quality of information at admission, communication among patients and providers, the clinician's knowledge and experience with the illness, and the clinician's attention to detail. Main error sources along the "paper trail" include variance in the electronic and written records, coder training and experience, facility quality-control efforts, and unintentional and intentional coder errors, such as misspecification, unbundling, and upcoding.By clearly specifying the code assignment process and heightening their awareness of potential error sources, code users can better evaluate the applicability and limitations of codes for their particular situations. ICD codes can then be used in the most appropriate ways.},

  Abstract       = {IMPORTANCE: Functional status assessment methods are important as outcome measures for pediatric critical care studies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between the 2 functional status assessment methods appropriate for large-sample studies, the Functional Status Scale (FSS) and the Pediatric Overall Performance Category and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (POPC/PCPC) scales. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study with random patient selection at 7 sites and 8 children's hospitals with general/medical and cardiac/cardiovascular pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network. Participants included all PICU patients younger than 18 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Functional Status Scale and POPC/PCPC scores determined at PICU admission (baseline) and PICU discharge. We investigated the association between the baseline and PICU discharge POPC/PCPC scores and the baseline and PICU discharge FSS scores, the dispersion of FSS scores within each of the POPC/PCPC ratings, and the relationship between the FSS neurologic components (FSS-CNS) and the PCPC. RESULTS: We included 5017 patients. We found a significant (P < .001) difference between FSS scores in each POPC or PCPC interval, with an FSS score increase with each worsening POPC/PCPC rating. The FSS scores for the good and mild disability POPC/PCPC ratings were similar and increased by 2 to 3 points for the POPC/PCPC change from mild to moderate disability, 5 to 6 points for moderate to severe disability, and 8 to 9 points for severe disability to vegetative state or coma. The dispersion of FSS scores within each POPC and PCPC rating was substantial and increased with worsening POPC and PCPC scores. We also found a significant (P < .001) difference between the FSS-CNS scores between each of the PCPC ratings with increases in the FSS-CNS score for each higher PCPC rating. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The FSS and POPC/PCPC system are closely associated. Increases in FSS scores occur with each higher POPC and PCPC rating and with greater magnitudes of change as the dysfunction severity increases. However, the dispersion of the FSS scores indicated a lack of precision in the POPC/PCPC system when compared with the more objective and granular FSS. The relationship between the PCPC and the FSS-CNS paralleled the relationship between the FSS and POPC/PCPC system.},

  Abstract       = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to create a functional status outcome measure for large outcome studies that is well defined, quantitative, rapid, reliable, minimally dependent on subjective assessments, and applicable to hospitalized pediatric patients across a wide range of ages and inpatient environments. METHODS: Functional Status Scale (FSS) domains of functioning included mental status, sensory functioning, communication, motor functioning, feeding, and respiratory status, categorized from normal (score                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          = 1) to very severe dysfunction (score = 5). The Adaptive Behavior Assessment System II (ABAS II) established construct validity and calibration within domains. Seven institutions provided PICU patients within 24 hours before or after PICU discharge, high-risk non-PICU patients within 24 hours after admission, and technology-dependent children. Primary care nurses completed the ABAS II. Statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 836 children, with a mean FSS score of 10.3 (SD: 4.4), were studied. Eighteen percent had the minimal possible FSS score of 6, 44% had FSS scores of >or = 10, 14% had FSS scores of >or = 15, and 6% had FSS scores of >or = 20. Each FSS domain was associated with mean ABAS II scores (P < .0001). Cells in each domain were collapsed and reweighted, which improved correlations with ABAS II scores (P < .001 for improvements). Discrimination was very good for moderate and severe dysfunction (ABAS II categories) and improved with FSS weighting. Intraclass correlations of original and weighted total FSS scores were 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The FSS met our objectives and is well suited for large outcome studies.},

  Abstract       = {OBJECTIVE: To examine disability in children and adolescents after traumatic brain injury (TBI) across the spectrum of injury severity. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of children younger than 18 years treated for a TBI (n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                = 729) or an arm injury (n = 197) between March 1, 2007, and September 30, 2008. The main outcome measures were disability in health-related quality of life, adaptive skills, and participation in social and community activities 3, 12, and 24 months after injury compared with preinjury functioning. RESULTS: The health-related quality of life for children with moderate or severe TBI was lower at all follow-up times compared with baseline, but there was some improvement during the first 2 years after injury. Three months after injury, there was a substantial decrease in the level of activities in which children with moderate and severe TBI were able to participate; these activities improved at 12 and 24 months but were still significantly impaired. Communication and self-care abilities in children with moderate and severe TBI were lower at 3 months than at baseline and did not improve by 24 months. Children who met the definition of mild TBI but had an intracranial hemorrhage had lower quality-of-life scores at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Children with moderate or severe TBI and children with mild TBI who had intracranial hemorrhage had substantial long-term reduction in their quality of life, participation in activities with others, and ability to communicate and care for themselves.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to obtain a broad understanding of inpatient deaths across academic children's hospitals. METHODS: A nonconcurrent cohort study of children hospitalized in 37 academic children's hospitals in 2005 was performed. The primary outcome was death. Patient characteristics including age, gender, race, diagnostic grouping, and insurance status and epidemiological measures including standardized mortality rate and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were used. RESULTS: A total of 427 615 patients were discharged during the study period, of whom 4529 (1.1%) died. Neonates had the highest mortality rate (4.03%; odds ratio: 8.66; P < .001), followed by patients >18 years of age (1.4%; odds ratio: 2.86; P < .001). The SMRs ranged from 0.46 (all patient-refined, diagnosis-related group 663, other anemias and disorders of blood) to 30.0 (all patient-refined, diagnosis-related group 383, cellulitis and other bacterial skin infections). When deaths were compared according to institution, there was considerable variability in both the number of children who died and the SMRs at those institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics, such as age, severity, and diagnosis, were all substantive factors associated with the death of children. Opportunities to improve the environment of care by reducing variability within and between hospitals may improve mortality rates for hospitalized children.},

  Abstract                 = {Clinical decision making often requires estimates of the likelihood of a dichotomous outcome in individual patients. When empirical data are available, these estimates may well be obtained from a logistic regression model. Several strategies may be followed in the development of such a model. In this study, the authors compare alternative strategies in 23 small subsamples from a large data set of patients with an acute myocardial infarction, where they developed predictive models for 30-day mortality. Evaluations were performed in an independent part of the data set. Specifically, the authors studied the effect of coding of covariables and stepwise selection on discriminative ability of the resulting model, and the effect of statistical "shrinkage" techniques on calibration. As expected, dichotomization of continuous covariables implied a loss of information. Remarkably, stepwise selection resulted in less discriminating models compared to full models including all available covariables, even when more than half of these were randomly associated with the outcome. Using qualitative information on the sign of the effect of predictors slightly improved the predictive ability. Calibration improved when shrinkage was applied on the standard maximum likelihood estimates of the regression coefficients. In conclusion, a sensible strategy in small data sets is to apply shrinkage methods in full models that include well-coded predictors that are selected based on external information.},

Several internal validation methods are available that aim to provide a more accurate estimate of model performance in new subjects. We evaluated several variants of split-sample, cross-validation and bootstrapping methods with a logistic regression model that included eight predictors for 30-day mortality after an acute myocardial infarction. Random samples with a size between n = 572 and n = 9165 were drawn from a large data set (GUSTO-I; n = 40,830; 2851 deaths) to reflect modeling in data sets with between 5 and 80 events per variable. Independent performance was determined on the remaining subjects. Performance measures included discriminative ability, calibration and overall accuracy. We found that split-sample analyses gave overly pessimistic estimates of performance, with large variability. Cross-validation on 10\% of the sample had low bias and low variability, but was not suitable for all performance measures. Internal validity could best be estimated with bootstrapping, which provided stable estimates with low bias. We conclude that split-sample validation is inefficient, and recommend bootstrapping for estimation of internal validity of a predictive logistic regression model.},

  Abstract                 = {The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration.Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision-analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions.We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration, we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n = 544 for model development, n = 273 for external validation).We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

Data examining the timing of central venous catheter insertion among critically ill patients admitted from the emergency department are limited. We examined the hypothesis that prompt central venous catheter insertion during hospitalization among patients admitted from the emergency department acts as a surrogate marker for early aggressive care in the management of critically ill patients.Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of emergency department visits using 2003-2006 discharge data from California, State Inpatient Databases, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.General medical or general surgical hospitals (n = 310).Patient hospitalizations beginning in the emergency department with the two most common diagnoses associated with central venous catheter (sepsis and respiratory arrest).None.We identified the occurrence and timing of central venous catheter using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modifications procedure codes. The primary outcomes measured were annual central venous catheters per 1,000 hospitalizations that began in the emergency department occurring emergently (procedure day 0), urgently (procedure day 1-2), or late (procedure day 3 or later). A total of 129,288 hospital discharges had evidence of central venous catheter. In 2003, 5,759 central venous catheters were placed emergently compared with 10,469 in 2006. The rate of emergent central venous catheter/1,000 increased annually from 228 in 2003, 239 in 2004, 257 in 2005, up to 269 in 2006. Urgent and late central venous catheter rates trended down (p < 0.001). In a multilevel model, the odds of undergoing emergent central venous catheter relative to 2003 increased annually: 1.08 (95\% CI, 1.03-1.12) in 2004, 1.19 (95\% CI, 1.14-1.23) in 2005, and 1.28 (95\% CI, 1.23-1.33) in 2006.Central venous catheters are inserted earlier and more frequently among critically ill patients admitted from the emergency department. Earlier central venous catheter insertion may require systematic changes to meet increasing utilization and enhanced mechanisms to measure central venous catheter outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Head injury is a major cause of morbidity and death in infants, and child abuse is among its chief causes. Retinal hemorrhages (RHs) are of paramount importance for the diagnosis of child abuse; however, their sensitivity and specificity are poorly estimated. Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common feature; however, its incidence and causative factors are poorly documented.To study the epidemiology of head injuries in infants, factors predisposing to SDH, value of RH for the diagnosis of child abuse, and prognostic factors, the authors prospectively collected data from cases of head injury in infants who were hospitalized at their institution over a 3-year period. One hundred fifty cases were collected, 57 of which were due to child abuse. This prospective study allows the comparison of clinical, radiological, and ophthalmological features in accidental and nonaccidental trauma in infants.Subdural hematomas were significantly correlated with RH and with child abuse but not with idiopathic macrocranium. The sensitivity and specificity of RH for the diagnosis of child abuse were 75 and 93.2\%, respectively. Retinal hemorrhages associated with accidental trauma were always mild, and the specificity of more severe RH for the diagnosis of child abuse was 100\%. The grading of RH requires the expertise of a trained neuroophthalmologist. Child abuse was also significantly associated with antecedents of perinatal illness, absence of signs of impact, and seizures on presentation. Although child abuse represented just 38\% of traumas, it was the cause of 71\% of deaths and 90\% of severe disability in this series. Abuse and the clinical severity on presentation were two significant and independent factors conditioning outcome.},

Multiple models of risk have been reported with variable discriminatory performances, and it remains unclear how design factors affect performance.To study the effects of varying three factors of model development in the prediction of risk based on health record data: (1) reason for readmission (primary readmission diagnosis); (2) available data and data types (e.g. visit history, laboratory results, etc); (3) cohort selection.Regularized regression (LASSO) to generate predictions of readmissions risk using prevalence sampling. Support Vector Machine (SVM) used for comparison in cohort selection testing. Calibration by model refitting to outcome prevalence.Predicting readmission risk across multiple reasons for readmission resulted in ROC areas ranging from 0.92 for readmission for congestive heart failure to 0.71 for syncope and 0.68 for all-cause readmission. Visit history and laboratory tests contributed the most predictive value; contributions varied by readmission diagnosis. Cohort definition affected performance for both parametric and nonparametric algorithms. Compared to all patients, limiting the cohort to patients whose index admission and readmission diagnoses matched resulted in a decrease in average ROC from 0.78 to 0.55 (difference in ROC 0.23, p value 0.01). Calibration plots demonstrate good calibration with low mean squared error.Targeting reason for readmission in risk prediction impacted discriminatory performance. In general, laboratory data and visit history data contributed the most to prediction; data source contributions varied by reason for readmission. Cohort selection had a large impact on model performance, and these results demonstrate the difficulty of comparing results across different studies of predictive risk modeling.},

  Abstract       = {OBJECTIVES: Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in children. Guidelines have been established to prevent secondary brain injury caused by hypotension or hypoxia. The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence, monitoring, and treatment of hypotension and hypoxia during "early" (prehospital and emergency department) care and to evaluate their relationship to vital status and neurologic outcomes at hospital discharge. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 299 children with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury presenting to a level 1 pediatric trauma center. We recorded vital signs and medical provider response to hypotension and/or hypoxia during all portions of early care. RESULTS: Blood pressure (31%) and oxygenation (34%) were not recorded during some portion of "early care." Documented hypotension occurred in 118 children (39%). An attempt to treat documented hypotension was made in 48% (57 of 118 children). After adjusting for severity of illness, children who did not receive an attempt to treat hypotension had an increased odds of death of 3.4 and were 3.7 times more likely to suffer disability compared with treated hypotensive children. Documented hypoxia occurred in 131 children (44%). An attempt to treat hypoxia was made in 92% (121 of 131 children). Untreated hypoxia was not significantly associated with death or disability, except in the setting of hypotension. CONCLUSIONS: Hypotension and hypoxia are common events in pediatric traumatic brain injury. Approximately one third of children are not properly monitored in the early phases of their management. Attempts to treat hypotension and hypoxia significantly improved outcomes.},

  abstract        = {Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the NICU. In 2010, Medicaid was mandated not to pay hospitals for treatment of CLABSI; however, the source of CLABSI data for this policy was not specified. Our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of hospital administrative data compared with CLABSI confirmed by an infection control service. We evaluated hospital administrative and infection control data for newborns admitted consecutively from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2010. Clinical and demographic data were collected through chart review. We compared cases of CLABSI identified by administrative data (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 999.31) with infection control data that use national criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the gold standard. To ascertain the nature possible deficiencies in the administrative data, each patient's medical record was searched to determine if clinical phrases that commonly refer to CLABSI appeared. Of 2920 infants admitted to the NICU during our study period, 52 were identified as having a CLABSI: 42 by infection control data only, 7 through hospital administrative data only, and 3 appearing in both. Against the gold standard, hospital administrative data were 6.7% sensitive and 99.7% specific, with a positive predictive value of 30.0% and a negative predictive value of 98.6%. Only 48% of medical records indicated a CLABSI. Our findings from a major children's hospital NICU indicate that International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 993.31 is presently not accurate and cannot be used reliably to compare CLABSI rates in NICUs.},

Retrospective cohort study at an HMO and two teaching hospitals in Boston, one adult (hospital A) and one pediatric (hospital B), between January 1991 and December 1997. Tunneled catheters, totally implanted catheters, and hemodialysis catheters were examined. Claims databases of both the HMO and the hospitals were searched for 10 CPT codes, 2 ICD-9 codes, and internal charge codes indicating CVC insertion. Lists were compared with each other and with medical records for correlation and accuracy. All members of the HMO who had a CVC inserted at one of the two hospitals during the study period. There was wide variation in the CVC insertions identified in each database. Although ICD-9 codes at each hospital and CPT/ICD-9 combinations at the HMO found similar total numbers of CVCs, there was little overlap between the individuals identified (62% for hospital A with HMO and 4% for hospital B). Claims data from different sources do not identify the same CVC insertion procedures. Current administrative databases are not ready to be used for electronic surveillance of CVC-associated complications without extensive modification and validation.},

Prospective observational cohort study, May 2013 to November 2015. Two U.S. children's hospitals designated as American College of Surgeons level 1 pediatric trauma centers. Children less than 18 years old admitted to an ICU with acute traumatic brain injury and either a surgical or critical care intervention within the first 24 hours or in-hospital mortality. None. The primary outcome was hospital discharge Functional Status Scale. Most, 133 of 196 (68%), had severe traumatic brain injury (admission Glasgow Coma Scale, 3-8). Overall hospital mortality was 14%; 20% among those with severe traumatic brain injury. Hospital discharge Functional Status Scale had an inverse relationship with Glasgow Coma Scale: for each increase in admission Glasgow Coma Scale by 1, the discharge Functional Status Scale decreased by 0.5 (95% CI, 0.7-0.3). Baseline Functional Status Scale was collected at one site (n = 75). At that site, nearly all (61/62) of the survivors had normal or near-normal (≤ 7) preinjury Functional Status Scale. More than one-third, 23 of 62 (37%), of survivors had new morbidity at hospital discharge (increase in Functional Status Scale, ≥ 3). Among children with severe traumatic brain injury who had baseline Functional Status Scale collected, 21 of 41 survivors (51%) had new morbidity at hospital discharge. The mean change in Functional Status Scale from baseline to hospital discharge was 3.9 ± 4.9 overall and 5.2 ± 5.4 in children with severe traumatic brain injury. More than one-third of survivors, and approximately half of survivors with severe traumatic brain injury, will have new morbidity. Hospital discharge Functional Status Scale, change from baseline Functional Status Scale, and new morbidity acquisition can be used as outcome measures for hospital-based care process improvement initiatives and interventional studies of children with traumatic brain injury.},

However, the interhospital variability and accuracy in data abstraction and coding have not yet been directly evaluated. This multi-institutional, Web-based, anonymous study examines interhospital variability and accuracy in data coding and scoring by registrars. Eighty-two American College of Surgeons (ACS)/state-verified Level I and II trauma centers were invited to determine different data elements including diagnostic, procedure, and Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) coding as well as selected National Trauma Data Bank definitions for the same fictitious case. Variability and accuracy in data entries were assessed by the maximal percent agreement among the registrars for the tested data elements, and 95% confidence intervals were computed to compare this level of agreement to the ideal value of 100%. Variability and accuracy in all elements were compared (χ testing) based on Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) membership, level of trauma center, ACS verification, and registrar's certifications. Fifty registrars (61%) completed the survey. The overall accuracy for all tested elements was 64%. Variability was noted in all examined parameters except for the place of occurrence code in all groups and the lower extremity AIS code in Level II trauma centers and in the Certified Specialist in Trauma Registry- and Certified Abbreviated Injury Scale Specialist-certified registrar groups. No differences in variability were noted when groups were compared based on TQIP membership, level of center, ACS verification, and registrar's certifications, except for prehospital Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), where TQIP respondents agreed more than non-TQIP centers (p = 0.004). There is variability and inaccuracy in interhospital data coding and scoring of injury information. This finding casts doubt on the validity of registry data used in all aspects of trauma care and injury surveillance.},

  abstract      = {Traditionally, patient groups with a phenotype are selected through rule-based definitions whose creation and validation are time-consuming. Machine learning approaches to electronic phenotyping are limited by the paucity of labeled training datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing semi-automatically labeled training sets to create phenotype models via machine learning, using a comprehensive representation of the patient medical record. We use a list of keywords specific to the phenotype of interest to generate noisy labeled training data. We train L1 penalized logistic regression models for a chronic and an acute disease and evaluate the performance of the models against a gold standard. Our models for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction achieve precision and accuracy of 0.90, 0.89, and 0.86, 0.89, respectively. Local implementations of the previously validated rule-based definitions for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction achieve precision and accuracy of 0.96, 0.92 and 0.84, 0.87, respectively.We have demonstrated feasibility of learning phenotype models using imperfectly labeled data for a chronic and acute phenotype. Further research in feature engineering and in specification of the keyword list can improve the performance of the models and the scalability of the approach. Our method provides an alternative to manual labeling for creating training sets for statistical models of phenotypes. Such an approach can accelerate research with large observational healthcare datasets and may also be used to create local phenotype models.},
